A repository filled with Codewars challenges known as Kata. Completed over 500+ challenges and I aim to push 5 solutions every week.   

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** <img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=JAVASCRIPT&color=3c7f5d&style=plastic&logo=javascript"/>

Everyday, I solve a Codewars challenge! It helps to keep my coding skills and brain fresh on the material. Additionally, I've added Python into the mix.
## Optimizations

I consistently optimize and refactor my code. Sometimes for efficiency, sometimes for readability, sometimes for both. 
## Lessons Learned:

Lessons that I learned in this completing the vast sea of questions is that it is a long journey and you may not know everything, actually you aren't expected to. What matters is taking the initiative to improve and figuring it out and staying consistent! Keep on the grind and keep pushing that ceiling.
