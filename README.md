A repository filled with Codewars challenges known as Kata. Completed over 500+ challenges and I push 5 solutions every week.   

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** <img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=JAVASCRIPT&color=3c7f5d&style=plastic&logo=javascript"/>

Everyday, I solve a Codewars challenge! It helps to keep my coding skills and brain fresh on the material.
## Optimizations

I consistently optimize and refactor my code. Sometimes for efficiency, sometimes for readability, sometimes for both. 
## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *fuck yeah I did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
The biggest lesson I learned in this completing the vast sea of quuestions is that it is a long journey and you may not know everything, actually you aren't expected to. What matters is taking the initiative to improve and figuring it out and staying consistent!
